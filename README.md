### Austin Bennett

I am pursuing a career in Backend / DevOps / Cloud. One of the things I love about being in DevOps is positively impacting the lives of the people I work with on a day-to-day basis. I am passionate about learning new technologies and tools that can help me improve my skills and make a difference in the industry.
